Learning [Docker by Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAkwW2tuIqE), this probably would be useful for creating a containerised dev environment for the apps.

Each container should run one process. If you use multiple containers, use docker compose to run at the same time.

Will watch this video by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyx2PsuwomE) later.
