## Where are global npm packages installed

The npm root -g command will tell you where that exact location is on your machine. 

On macOS or Linux this location could be /usr/local/lib/node_modules. On Windows it could be C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules If you use nvm to manage Node.js versions, however, that location would differ.

For example, if your username is 'joe' and you use nvm, then packages location will show as /Users/joe/.nvm/versions/node/v8.9.0/lib/node_modules.

## Semantic Versioning using npm

The Semantic Versioning concept is simple: all versions have 3 digits: x.y.z.

the first digit is the major version
the second digit is the minor version
the third digit is the patch version
